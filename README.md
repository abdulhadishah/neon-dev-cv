# Neon Dev CV

This is an old CV + portfolio page I made when I was learning HTML, CSS, and a bit of jQuery.

It’s a single-page layout with a fixed sidebar, smooth scrolling, and a neon cyber theme. I cleaned it up recently to fix spacing, make the colors more consistent, and tidy the code, but it still stays close to the original version.

### Live demo

### Built with
- HTML  
- CSS  
- jQuery (for menu toggle + smooth scroll)

### Notes
This was one of my first projects that used JavaScript at all, so I’m keeping it here as a record of my early JS learning.

Nothing advanced here, just early practice.
